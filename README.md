## ClearScore Home page -  FED Roadmap Project

This is a project that one of the Devs at ClearScore recommended I tackle. The 
idea being that I wasn't confident with my basic HTML and CSS and this was a 
chance to remake an actual website. Intially I wrote this in native HTML and CSS
using Flexbox, I then remake it using React. If I had more time on it then I 
would make it mobile responsive. 

**Brief:**
1. Rebuild the ClearScore homepage (above the fold) from scratch.
2. Build for a laptop screen. Don't worry about mobile responsive.
3. Build in React using Create-React-App.
4. Don't use Chrome Dev tools to see exact styling on actual homepage.

**Main Lessons Learnt:**
* Implementing Flexbox
* Inspecting production code
* Generally building a website in React.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start`
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

*This project was retired in April 2018.*
