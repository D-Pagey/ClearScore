## ClearScore Home page -  FED Roadmap Project

**Brief:**
1. Rebuild the ClearScore homepage (above the fold) from scratch.
2. Build for a laptop screen. Don't worry about mobile responsive initially.
3. Build in React using Create-React-App.
4. Don't use Chrome Dev tools to see exact styling on actual homepage.

This is a project to practice rebuilding a live website in React.

**Improvements:**
- I had to use free fonts as didn't have access to the actual fonts used.
- I'd like to work out how to zoom the background image further as per the 
homepage.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
