## ClearScore Home page -  FED Roadmap Project

**Brief:**
1. Rebuild the ClearScore homepage (above the fold) from scratch.
2. Build for a laptop screen. Don't worry about mobile responsive initially.
3. Build in Atom and not CodePen. (Although can demo it in CodePen).
4. Don't use Chrome Dev tools to see exact styling.
5. Don't use frameworks or libraries.

This is a project for me to focus on improving my HTML and CSS skills, as well as learning to build a page from a design spec.
